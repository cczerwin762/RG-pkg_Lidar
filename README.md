# RG-pkg-Lidar (ROS-GAZEBO)
Made to work with Dolly project found at: https://github.com/chapulina/dolly
Created with the tutorial videos from 'The Construct'
This project builds off my earlier project First-RG-pkg. It implements a subscriber that gets real time data from Dolly's laser scan, and it moves using a publisher that publishes to /cmd_vel.
